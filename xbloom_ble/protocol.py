"""Byte-exact xBloom Studio BLE wire protocol.

This module is a pure (no-BLE) port of the *verified*, round-trip-proven
builders that were reverse-engineered from an Android Bluetooth HCI capture.
It is what lets the rest of the package talk to the machine without guessing.

Frame format
------------
Every command frame written to the ``ffe1`` characteristic is::

    58 01 01 | CMD(u8) | SEQ(u8) | LEN(u16le) | 00 00 | PAYLOAD | CRC16(u16le)

* ``58 01 01`` — constant header.
* ``CMD``      — command opcode (see below).
* ``SEQ``      — sequence byte. The load sequence uses ``0x1f`` (31).
* ``LEN``      — total frame length in bytes, little-endian, *including* header
  and CRC. Stored at offset 5.
* ``00 00``    — two constant zero bytes.
* ``PAYLOAD``  — command-specific body.
* ``CRC16``    — CRC-16/KERMIT over the whole frame except the last two bytes,
  stored little-endian.

CRC-16/KERMIT: polynomial ``0x1021``, init ``0``, reflected input and output,
no final XOR.

GATT
----
Vendor service ``0000e0ff-3c17-d293-8e48-14fe2e4da212`` exposes:

* ``ffe1`` — command (write).
* ``ffe2`` — status (notify).
* ``ffe3`` — aux.

The LOAD sequence (this package's only job)
-------------------------------------------
Sent frame-by-frame, waiting for each ACK on ``ffe2``:

1. ``0xa4`` — session start (constant payload ``01b900000001000000``).
2. ``0xa6`` — dose (grams as ``u8`` at payload offset 9).
3. ``0xa8`` — stage temps (``01`` + f32le temp1 + f32le temp2, default 110/90).
4. ``0x41`` — pours + grind.

After these four frames the machine reports STATE ``0x1f`` (armed/loaded). At
that point you can either approve the brew **on the machine** or start it
remotely (below), exactly like the official app.

Starting a brew (commit / start / cancel)
-----------------------------------------
Loading only *arms* the machine. To start the brew remotely — the way the app
does when you tap "Brew" — three further single-byte frames are used:

* ``0x42`` (seq ``0x1f``) — **commit**: the machine moves to ``0x1e``
  (awaiting-confirm) and shows its ~99 s add-beans countdown.
* ``0x46`` (seq ``0x9e``) — **start**: the "go" — the machine begins brewing.
* ``0x47`` (seq ``0x9e``) — **cancel**: abort a committed/running brew.

All three carry the constant one-byte payload ``01`` and were captured
byte-for-byte from the vendor app (:func:`build_commit`, :func:`build_start`,
:func:`build_cancel`).

⚠️ SAFETY — loading and starting are separate, explicit steps
-------------------------------------------------------------
Starting a brew physically dispenses near-boiling water. The design keeps that
deliberate: :func:`build_load_frames` returns **only** the four LOAD frames and
never a commit/start opcode, so *loading a recipe can never brew by accident*.
The commit/start frames live in their own builders and are only emitted when a
caller explicitly asks to start (or cancel) a brew. Never wire commit/start as a
side effect of loading — only in response to a clear, intentional "start" action
with the machine physically ready.
